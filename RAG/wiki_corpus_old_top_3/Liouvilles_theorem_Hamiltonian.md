In physics, Liouville's theorem, named after the French mathematician Joseph Liouville, is a key theorem in classical statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics. It asserts that the phase-space distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system—that is that the density of system points in the vicinity of a given system point traveling through phase-space is constant with time. This time-independent density is in statistical mechanics known as the classical a priori probability.
Liouville's theorem applies to conservative systems, that is, systems in which the effects of friction are absent or can be ignored. The general mathematical formulation for such systems is the measure-preserving dynamical system.  Liouville's theorem applies when there are degrees of freedom that can be interpreted as positions and momenta; not all measure-preserving dynamical systems have these, but Hamiltonian systems do. The general setting for conjugate position and momentum coordinates is available in the mathematical setting of symplectic geometry. Liouville's theorem ignores the possibility of chemical reactions, where the total number of particles may change over time, or where energy may be transferred to internal degrees of freedom.  The non-squeezing theorem, which applies to all symplectic maps (the Hamiltonian is a symplectic map) implies further restrictions on phase-space flows beyond volume/density/measure conservation. There are extensions of Liouville's theorem to cover these various generalized settings, including stochastic systems.

The Liouville equation describes the time evolution of the phase space distribution function. Josiah Willard Gibbs was the first to recognize this as the fundamental equation of statistical mechanics. It is referred to as the Liouville equation because its derivation for non-canonical systems utilises an identity first derived by Liouville in 1838.

Time derivatives are denoted by dots, and are evaluated according to Hamilton's equations for the system. This equation demonstrates the conservation of density in phase space (which was Gibbs's name for the theorem). Liouville's theorem states that:

A proof of Liouville's theorem uses the n-dimensional divergence theorem. The proof is based on the fact that the evolution of 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
  
 obeys an 2n-dimensional version of the continuity equation:

        d

    {\displaystyle d\rho /dt}
  
, is zero follows from the equation of continuity by noting that the 'velocity field' 
  
    
      
        (

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle ({\dot {p}},{\dot {q}})}

=== Ergodic theory ===
In ergodic theory and dynamical systems, motivated by the physical considerations given so far, there is a corresponding result also referred to as Liouville's theorem. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the phase space is a smooth manifold that comes naturally equipped with a smooth measure (locally, this measure is the 6n-dimensional Lebesgue measure). The theorem says this smooth measure is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow. More generally, one can describe the necessary and sufficient condition under which a smooth measure is invariant under a flow. The Hamiltonian case then becomes a corollary.


=== Symplectic geometry ===
We can also formulate Liouville's Theorem in terms of symplectic geometry. For a given system, we can consider the phase space 
  
    
      
        (
        
          q
          
            μ
          
        
        ,
        
          p
          
            μ
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (q^{\mu },p_{\mu })}
  
 of a particular Hamiltonian 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  
 as a manifold 
  
    
      
        (
        M
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (M,\omega )}
  
 endowed with a symplectic 2-form

  
    
      
        ω
        =
        d
        
          p
          
            μ
          
        
        ∧
        d
        
          q
          
            μ
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega =dp_{\mu }\wedge dq^{\mu }.}
  

The volume form of our manifold is the top exterior power of the symplectic 2-form, and is just another representation of the measure on the phase space described above.
On our phase space symplectic manifold we can define a Hamiltonian vector field generated by a function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        q
        ,
        p
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(q,p)}
  
 as

  
    
      
        
          X
          
            f
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              ∂

In this formalism, Liouville's Theorem states that the Lie derivative of the volume form is zero along the flow generated by 
  
    
      
        
          X
          
            H
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X_{H}}
  
. That is, for 
  
    
      
        (
        M
        ,
        ω
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (M,\omega )}
  
 a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold,

  
    
      
        
          
            
              L
            
          
          
            
              X
              
                H
              
            
          
        
        (
        
          ω
          
            n

        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X_{H}}(\omega ^{n})=0.}
  

In fact, the symplectic structure 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  
 itself is preserved, not only its top exterior power. That is, Liouville's Theorem also gives

        )
        =
        0.

=== Quantum Liouville equation ===
The analog of Liouville equation in quantum mechanics describes the time evolution of a mixed state.  Canonical quantization yields a quantum-mechanical version of this theorem, the von Neumann equation.  This procedure, often used to devise quantum analogues of classical systems, involves describing a classical system using Hamiltonian mechanics.  Classical variables are then re-interpreted as quantum operators, while Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators.  In this case, the resulting equation is

  
    
      
        
          
            
              ∂
              ρ
            
            
              ∂
              t
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            
              i
              ℏ
            
          
        
        [
        H
        ,
        ρ
        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}={\frac {1}{i\hbar }}[H,\rho ],}
  

where ρ is the density matrix.
When applied to the expectation value of an observable, the corresponding equation is given by Ehrenfest's theorem, and takes the form

  
    
      
        
          
            d
            
              d
              t
            
          
        
        ⟨
        A
        ⟩
        =
        −
        
          
            1
            
              i
              ℏ
            
          
        
        ⟨
        [
        H
        ,
        A
        ]
        ⟩
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle A\rangle =-{\frac {1}{i\hbar }}\langle [H,A]\rangle ,}
  

where 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
 is an observable. Note the sign difference, which follows from the assumption that the operator is stationary and the state is time-dependent.
In the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, substituting the Moyal brackets for Poisson brackets in the phase-space analog of the von Neumann equation results in compressibility of the probability fluid, and thus violations of Liouville's theorem incompressibility. This, then, leads to concomitant difficulties in defining meaningful quantum trajectories.

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle dq_{i}'dp_{i}'=dq_{i}dp_{i}.}
  

From this we can find the infinitesimal volume of phase space:

        =
        
          ∏
          
            i
            =

            N

          d
          
            3

            i
          
          ′
        
        =
        
          ∏
          
            i
            =
            1
          
          
            N
          
        
        
          d
          
            3
          
        
        
          q
          
            i
          
        
        
          d
          
            3

            i
          
        
        =
        
          d
        
        Γ
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \Gamma '=\prod _{i=1}^{N}d^{3}q_{i}'d^{3}p_{i}'=\prod _{i=1}^{N}d^{3}q_{i}d^{3}p_{i}=\mathrm {d} \Gamma .}
  

Thus we have ultimately found that the infinitesimal phase-space volume is unchanged, yielding

  
    
      
        ρ
        (
        
          Γ

demonstrating that Liouville's theorem holds for this system.
The question remains of how the phase-space volume actually evolves in time. Above we have shown that the total volume is conserved, but said nothing about what it looks like. For a single particle we can see that its trajectory in phase space is given by the ellipse of constant 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  
. Explicitly, one can solve Hamilton's equations for the system and find

=== Damped harmonic oscillator ===

 particles each in a 
  
    
      
        3
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3}
  
-dimensional isotropic harmonic potential, the Hamiltonian for which is given in the previous example. This time, we add the condition that each particle experiences a frictional force

, where 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
  
 is a positive constant dictating the amount of friction. As this is a non-conservative force, we need to extend Hamilton's equations as

Unlike the equations of motion for the simple harmonic oscillator, these modified equations do not take the form of Hamilton's equations, and therefore we do not expect Liouville's theorem to hold. Instead, as depicted in the animation in this section, a generic phase space volume will shrink as it evolves under these equations of motion.
To see this violation of Liouville's theorem explicitly, we can follow a very similar procedure to the undamped harmonic oscillator case, and we arrive again at

We have found that the infinitesimal phase-space volume is no longer constant, and thus the phase-space density is not conserved. As can be seen from the equation as time increases, we expect our phase-space volume to decrease to zero as friction affects the system.
As for how the phase-space volume evolves in time, we will still have the constant rotation as in the undamped case. However, the damping will introduce a steady decrease in the radii of each ellipse. Again we can solve for the trajectories explicitly using Hamilton's equations, taking care to use the modified ones above. Letting

As the system evolves the total phase-space volume will spiral in to the origin. This can be seen in the figure above.


== Remarks ==
The Liouville equation is valid for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. It is a fundamental equation of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
The Liouville equation is integral to the proof of the fluctuation theorem from which the second law of thermodynamics can be derived.  It is also the key component of the derivation of Green–Kubo relations for linear transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, thermal conductivity or electrical conductivity.
Virtually any textbook on Hamiltonian mechanics, advanced statistical mechanics, or symplectic geometry will derive the Liouville theorem.
In plasma physics, the Vlasov equation can be interpreted as Liouville's theorem, which reduces the task of solving the Vlasov equation to that of single particle motion. By using Liouville's theorem in this way with energy or magnetic moment conservation, for example, one can determine unknown fields using known particle distribution functions, or vice versa. This method is known as Liouville mapping.
